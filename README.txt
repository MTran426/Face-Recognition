# Face-Recognition
# Project Goal: Be able to upload employee photos to a MySQL database with their name and employee number stored, and then create a webpage using Apache, PHP, and Javascript 
# that accesses the device that navigates to the hosted website's camera. And then, program will reference the photos stored in the database 
# and match the photos in the database to the face that is being shown in the live webcam feed and display the employee's name.
